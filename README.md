### A simple RTS made in Unity
BoxCraft is an engaging RTS game where you take control of adorable, sentient Boxes. As the supreme cube commander, your mission is to expand your box civilization, gather resources, construct buildings, and defend against evil, enemy Boxes.




### Procedurally generated map
Each game starts with a unique landscape. Resources are scattered randomly. You need to adapt your strategy based on the terrain shape and available resources. Natural bottlenecks and pathways emerge organically, influencing Box movement and base placement.
